The core and 18 plugins are free and open-source, under a modified MIT license called the Freedom license. 
See http://imageresizing.net/licenses/freedom

The following DLLs are under the Freedom license:

* ImageResizer.dll
* ImageResizer.Mvc.dll 
* ImageResizer.Plugins.Logging.dll 


Development of this project is funded by purchases of the Performance, Creative, and Elite editions. All licenses are as MIT-like as possible, allowing redistribution, modification, and sub-licensing.

The free trial license permits use of the paid plugins for development and testing purposes, but not for production use.

Once you begin using them on a production server, you will need to purchase a license.

See http://imageresizing.net/plugins for information on buying licuenses.
